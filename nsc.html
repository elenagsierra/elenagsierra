<h1>Science Communication</h1>
<p>At Stanford, I am pursuing a 
Notation in Science Communication. As a part of this
Notation, I build skills to effectively communicate
data and scientific findings to a variety of audiences
effectively. While I work on a variety of topics, I focus
my works on communicating equity gaps in data, algorithms,
and opinions in Notation coursework. </p>
