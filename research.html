<h1>Research</h1>
<p>As a researcher, I focus on building AI techniques with 
  beneficial use cases, like improving biodiversity 
  monitoring.
  I am currently working in the Moi lab at Stanford / Carnegie Science / 
  UC Berkeley under the supervision of Lauren Gillespie.
  My main research project looks at new machine learning
  techniques to improve ground-level plant image classification,
  specificaly looking at ways to incorporate biology concepts
  into contrastive learning pair selection.
  Summer 2024, I went to the University of Freiburg to work with the department
  of sensor-based geoinformatics (geosense) to work on a project analyzing the 
  impact of volunteer-collected biodiveristy data bias on deep-learning model
  performance. This work was accepted to the NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Tackling
  Climate Change with AI and is in review at AAAI (AI for Social Impact).

  Before finding my current interests, I spent Summer 2021 researching
  carbon tax policies under David Fedor for the Stanford
  Precourt Institute for Energy. This research resulted in a
  literature review and a poster presentation at Stanford
  ASURPS.
