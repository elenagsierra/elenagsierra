title: Algorithmic Hiring Bias
---
<h1>Algorithmic Hiring Bias</h1>
<p>During my sophomore year of college, 
    I decided to apply for summer internships. 
    After I submitted many applications to similar companies, 
    many required that I complete a "game" at the screening stage 
    of the hiring process to determine whether I got an interview. 
    I quickly became curious how a game could determine whether 
    I deserve an interview and discovered that companies use 
    algorithmic hiring to compare applicants' performances on 
    these games to current employees to screen them. 
    This instantly worried me as someone who is a 
    minority in the careers I am pursuing. 
    If companies are comparing me to their past employees, 
    a group of people that does not contain many like myself, 
    how will the companies judge me fairly with these "games"?</p>
    <p>I decided to research algorithmic hiring bias with a focus on 
        gender and created a presentation about this process to explain 
        why companies use them, the bias within them, 
        the research priorities and engineering innovation processes, and next steps.</p>
<h2>Slide Presentation</h2>

    figures that illustrate problems and potential solutions to algorithmic hiring bias, 
    and images of news headlines about Amazon's gender-biased hiring algorithm.</figcaption>

<p>I created this slide deck to assist my scripted presentation for adults that are familiar with 
    algorithmic hiring but do not know much about bias in this process.</p>
<p>I had given many speeches before giving this presentation, 
    so the greatest area of focus was on the slide deck. 
    I focused on visuals to ensure the audience focuses on the words the speaker says. 
    Instead of just using bullet points to follow my speaking points, 
    I utilized colors, diagrams, and pictures to make the presentation more engaging. 
    I also utilized black slides to ensure listeners would not be distracted by the screen when necessary.</p>
<p>This presentation connects with my passion for equity and 
    my desire to explore and understand fields related to technology. 
    Exploring algorithmic hiring bias allows me to explore equity in hiring processes and 
    how math and machine learning can contribute and fight discrimination in algorithmic hiring. 
    This artifact also taught me how to effectively educate others on this topic. 
    This artifact allowed me to improve my teaching skills and connect technology and equity communication, 
    which is my main goal as a science communicator.</p>
<p>I have also included the speaker notes and how 
    I divided up my slides for the presentation and a practice video over the 
    first half of my presentation below to give more insight to how 
    these slides contributed to a cohesive presentation. 
    I included these "less polished pieces" because the range and effectiveness 
    of the slide deck does not stand well by itself because 
    it is a supporting artifact, not the entire final product.</p>

<h2>Research Based Argument Paper</h2>

<p>The presentation above stemmed from my research based argument paper called <i>Bias in Algorithmic Hiring</i>. 
    This paper dives deeper than the presentation into case studies and details regarding the topic. 
    I have written a researched based argument before, but 
    this was the first time I had to give specific steps to start decreasing bias in hiring arlgorithms.</p>
<h2>Integrating De-Biasing Methods In Coursework</h2>
<p>One exciting component of this project is that 
    I discussed my research with my linear algebra professor, Stephen Boyd from the Electrical Engineering Department. 
    In this discussion, I told him how topics from the course like 
    constrained least squares and multi-objective least squares could help 
    de-bias algorithmic hiring processes. 
    We also discussed how we rarely mention 
    positive applications of linear algebra, such as de-biasing, in the course.</p>
<p>We ended up agreeing that de-biasing should be something that students are exposed to in the course, 
    so they can understand how the concepts they are learning can directly make an impact in de-biasing algorithmic processes. 
    After that discussion, the teaching team made an exam problem on algorithmic hiring.</p>
