I am an student at Stanford University pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. I am passionate about researching and building technologies that benefit humanity and the world. I am especially interested in using machine learning and data science to improve equity in algorithms and sustainability efforts. After Stanford, I hope to pursue a PhD in Computer Science, Data Science, or Social & Engineering Systems starting in fall 2025.
