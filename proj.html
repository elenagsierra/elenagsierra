<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>As an engineering student, I have built many projects.
  The two projects I had the most creative freedom are 
  Treasure Hunt on a Bare-Metal Raspberry Pi and Arduino
  Flappy Bird.
  Alongside these projects, I have made a speaker with an
  AC to DC converter and a Class D Amplifier, a music player
  using Digital Systems Design in Veriglog on an FPGA board,
  and various signal decoding and filtering algorithms.
