<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p>I teach CS 103ACE: </p>
<p>I taught introductory computer science as a
  Section Leader at Stanford for over three years.
  In this role, I taught weekly 1 hour sections
  for CS 106A and CS 106B, held office hours, and
  graded and gave feedback on assignments and exams.
</p><p>
  During this time, I have created some general study
  sheets and lesson plans on concepts like linked lists,
  recursive backtracking, tree traversals, and more.
